# Personal-Website-Bulma
Same thing as my other website, but I'm testing a responsive framework called "Bulma"

I decidec to do this after making my first website, and It not being able to fit mobile and tablet screens. It wouldn't even fit a laptop screen! So I added the Bulma CSS Framework into my website to fix that problem. You can view both my original Website and my Bulma framework added website here:
