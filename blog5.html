          <h1 style="text-align: center; padding:15px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Front-end Development Trends for 2019</h1>
          <h2 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Frameworks</h2>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Vue.js</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%">A very easy-to-learn and flexible environment for creating front-ends, which allows writing code with a low possibility for error.  It was designed to help designers who had little programming experience to direct all their efforts to the creation of functional interfaces. In addition, Vue.js supports declarative rendering, asynchronous DOM updates, two-way data binding, strict adherence to web component specifications and simple integration with HTML templates.</p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Angular</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%">First, this framework combines Javascript with HTML and CSS. Second, it is ideal for teamwork, because the application it creates can be clearly divided into components - business logic and frontend. This is possible because the development environment is based on the MVVM (Model-View-View-model) template. Third, Angular is ideal for the creation of scalable applications and supports simple integration with third-party libraries. This framework is often used to build dynamic mobile software because it uses two-way data binding, which increases the responsiveness of applications with an abundance of animated elements.</p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">React</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%">React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in application. This corresponds to view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript  libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.</p>
          <h2 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Languages</h2>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">JavaScript</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">JavaScript is going nowhere but up! Javascript is a very powerful language and easy to learn language. It keeps becoming one of the best languages that programmers enjoy because it is very easy to code in javascript and using javascript is like making a an ugly website to a very interactive website. Javascript attracts users very much because of it’s features. JavaScript is used by most people to do certain tasks from a day to day basis. And So for it JavaScript will be the trend programming language always.</p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">PHP7</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">I just got done the other day answering a question on Quora and the question was “Is it necessary to know PHP if I'm applying for a Software Engineer position at Facebook?”. I thought to myself before answer the question. I thought of all the places you’ll need PHP. And now with PHP7 coming out, I think It just might be popular in 2019.</p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Python</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">Some say that Python has already beat Java in the Job world. Other’s say Java is still at the top. But more and more people are starting to learn programming in 2019. And with that early programmers are looking for the easiest way to start programming, and usually they end up with Python. Python is way easier than Java, but Java is still what employers are looking for in the job market. Java is still a REALLY good language but might be taken over in 2019.</p>
          <h2 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Design (UI/UX)</h2>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">One Page Websites</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">“UX makes us think more carefully about the concept of single-page sites and in a couple of years, probably, we will have just been looking at the animation on the screen and nod to those products that we want to buy.” -<a target="_blank" href="http://merehead.com/blog/web-development-trends-2019/">Merehead.com</a> </p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">CSS Responsive frameworks</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">The more and more phones that are released, the more website have to adapt to them.
And make our websites responsiveness with new mobile phones. Which means CSS Responsive frameworks are going to get popular in 2019. Bulma and Bootstrap are some responsive frameworks that work on mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop! They work great with many mobiles and they are called the best css libraries for styling a website. So CSS Responsive Frameworks will definately be a trend in 2019.</p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Typography</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">“The law of a limited number of fonts is still valid, but the variety in use has become bolder. Whereas before we could observe the most simple sans-serif fonts, today the digital typography collections are replenished with new letters.” -<a target="_blank" href="http://merehead.com/blog/web-development-trends-2019/">Merehead.com</a> </p></p>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Chat’s/Forms</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">Websites are starting to leave places at the bottom where you can leave a comment about there blog. Or a pop-up asking you if you “have any questions” and that “We have someone that can help you live”.</p>
          <h2 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">CSS preprocessor</h2>
          <h3 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">SASS</h3>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%">SASS is a stylesheet just like CSS. But it is more useful and easy to use stylesheet.
In SASS, we don’t have to write thousands of lines for Styling.One of the great benefits of using a CSS preprocessors like SASS is the ability to use variables. A variable allows us to store a value or a set of values, and to reuse these variables throughout our SASS files as many times you want and wherever you want. Easy, powerful, and useful  SASS is used in complicated websites where there is thousands of lines of styling, so there SASS is used and it will be very helpful in 2019.</p>
          <h2 style="padding:15px; margin: 0 15% 0 15%; text-align: center;">Text Editor</h2>
          <p style="padding:15px;margin: 0 15% 0 15%"> Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Using Atom we can collaborate and also we can share our code with our collaborators. So it will be very helpful to share code in 2019.</p>
